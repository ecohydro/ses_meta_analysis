# Data and Notebooks for SES Meta Analysis

This repo contains data and python notebooks for generating figures for our SES Metadata Analysis manuscript, "Uncoupled Data in Coupled Natural Human Systems".

The `.csv` file is derived from analysis of the raw Qaultrix data, which can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19tbrRV2kA8yXYDsm4XTUT6z3_K9e0leQHhbvSHVqBrE/edit?usp=sharing).
